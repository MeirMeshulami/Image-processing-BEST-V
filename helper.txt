# ======== Frame journey from the gRPC to the GUI

startServer() -> StartFrameReceiverThread() -> new thread : RunFrameReceiver()- build the server and lisener.
grpc::SendFrame()-> get img from gRPC and decoded it -> PushFrameIntoQueue() .
QObject::ServerAPIController::pollFramesForDisplay()- pop img from queue -> frameReady()-signal the frame is ready-> displayFrame()->gets the img from the signal?
 
 
 
 # ======  API's =============
 
 the thread one the GUI calls to the "ServerAPIController" that calls to the "serverAPI" and that calls to the server funcs.
 API.h need to be removed probably..
